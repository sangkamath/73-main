/**

 * The time complexity of the function `deleteNthNodeFromEnd` is O(L), where L is the length of the linked list. This is because the function traverses the list twice: first to advance the pointer `q` by `n` nodes, and then to move both pointers `p` and `q`
 *  until `q` reaches the end of the list. Each traversal takes 
 * linear time relative to the number of nodes in the list.

The space complexity is O(1), as the function uses a constant 
amount of extra space regardless of the size of the input linked 
list. It only utilizes a few pointers (`p` and `q`) to keep track
 of the current nodes, without requiring any additional data 
 structures that scale with the input size.
