‚úî Uses a Map for efficient storage (fast lookups).
‚úî Prevents duplicate related words (using Sets).
‚úî Optimized for memory usage (no redundant storage).
‚úî Supports adding words, retrieving synonyms, and merging relationships.

üìå Explanation
Efficient Storage

Uses a Map where each word points to a Set of related words (avoiding duplication).
Insertion (addWord)

Adds words and establishes bidirectional relationships between synonyms.
Retrieval (getSynonyms)

Returns an array of synonyms for a word.
Check Synonym Relationship (areSynonyms)

Quickly checks if two words are synonyms.
Removal (removeWord)

Deletes a word and removes it from related words' lists.
Merging (mergeWords)

Merges two words' synonym lists to combine their meanings.
üöÄ Performance & Memory Optimization
Avoids redundancy using a Set (no duplicate words).
Direct Map lookup (O(1)) ensures fast retrieval and checking.
Bidirectional linking ensures related words always reference each other.
This Thesaurus is now optimized for speed, memory, and ease of use! üéâ

Time & Space Complexity Analysis of Thesaurus (Union-Find Approach)
This implementation uses Union-Find (Disjoint Set) with Path Compression and Union by Size, making operations efficient.

1Ô∏è‚É£ find(word) (with path compression)
Time Complexity:
In the worst case, finding the root would take O(Œ±(N)), where Œ±(N) is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows extremely slowly (nearly O(1) in practice).
Path compression ensures that the tree height remains small.
Space Complexity:
O(1) (only updates parent references).
2Ô∏è‚É£ mergeWords(word1, word2) (Union by Size)
Time Complexity:

Finding each root: O(Œ±(N))
Merging two sets: O(min(S1, S2)), where S1, S2 are the set sizes.
Since the size of a set at most doubles in each merge, the total number of merges is at most O(log N).
Overall Complexity: O(Œ±(N) + log N) ‚âà O(log N) in the worst case.
Space Complexity:

The worst-case storage for parent and synonyms is O(W + S), where:
W is the number of words.
S is the number of synonym relationships.
3Ô∏è‚É£ getSynonyms(word)
Time Complexity:

Finding the root: O(Œ±(N))
Converting the Set to an array: O(S), where S is the size of the synonym set.
Overall Complexity: O(Œ±(N) + S) ‚âà O(S) in practice.
Space Complexity:

O(S) (output array size).
4Ô∏è‚É£ areSynonyms(word1, word2)
Time Complexity:

Finding the root of both words: O(Œ±(N))
Total: O(Œ±(N)) ‚âà O(1) in practice.
Space Complexity:

O(1) (no extra space used).
Overall Complexity Summary
Operation	Time Complexity	Space Complexity
find(word)	O(Œ±(N))	O(1)
mergeWords(w1, w2)	O(log N)	O(W + S)
getSynonyms(w)	O(S)	O(S)
areSynonyms(w1, w2)	O(1)	O(1)
Path compression and union by size make this nearly optimal.
Worst-case merging takes O(log N), but O(Œ±(N)) dominates in practice.
Space complexity is O(W + S), which is minimal for maintaining synonym groups.

    /*
üî• Why is this better?
‚úÖ Faster merging: O(Œ±(n)) (almost constant) compared to O(n) for the original approach.
‚úÖ Efficient lookup: Uses path compression, making find() very fast.
‚úÖ Prevents redundant iterations: Only one parent lookup per word instead of modifying sets multiple times.
