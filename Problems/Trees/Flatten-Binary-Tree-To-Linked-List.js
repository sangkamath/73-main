Start at curr = 1
curr.left = 2 exists, so we find runner (rightmost node of left subtree)

runner moves to 4, which is the rightmost node of 2's subtree.
Attach runner.right = curr.right (5), so 4's right now points to 5.
Rewiring Step
Set curr.right = curr.left (2), so 1‚Äôs right now points to 2.
Set curr.left = null.

Now, curr = 2, and the process repeats.
Eventually, every left subtree gets moved to the right.
Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(N)
Each node is visited once, and we traverse its left subtree 
(finding runner takes at most height of tree 
O(H), but overall, we visit each node once).
Space Complexity: O(1)
No extra data structures are used‚Äîjust pointers are modified in place.
Key Takeaways
‚úÖ Uses in-place modification (no extra space).
‚úÖ Iterative solution avoids recursion overhead.
‚úÖ Mimics preorder traversal (root ‚Üí left ‚Üí right).

/*
You can solve this problem using recursion by following the same preorder traversal order (root ‚Üí left ‚Üí right) and rewiring the tree as you go. Here‚Äôs how:

Recursive Approach
Base Case: If root is null, return.
Flatten Left and Right Subtrees: Recursively flatten root.left and root.right.
Rewire Pointers:
Store the original root.right in a temporary variable.
Move root.left to root.right.
Find the rightmost node of the new root.right (previously root.left).
Attach the original root.right (stored earlier) to this rightmost node.
Set root.left to null.

var flatten = function(root) {
    if (!root) return; // Base case

    // Recursively flatten left and right subtrees
    flatten(root.left);
    flatten(root.right);

    // Store the original right subtree
    let tempRight = root.right;

    // Move left subtree to right
    root.right = root.left;
    root.left = null; // Set left to null

    // Find the rightmost node of the new right subtree
    let curr = root;
    while (curr.right) {
        curr = curr.right;
    }

    // Attach the original right subtree
    curr.right = tempRight;

Start at 1

Recursively flatten 2
Recursively flatten 5
Flattening 2:

Recursively flatten 3
Recursively flatten 4
Once 3 and 4 are flattened, 2 is transformed into:
